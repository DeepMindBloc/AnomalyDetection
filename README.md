# AnomalyDetection
Anomaly detection for identifying suspicious patterns

Uses Isolation Forest algorithm to detect suspicious transactions


Considers transaction amount, time of day, and day of week


Labels transactions as 'Suspicious' or 'Normal'

Key Features:
1. Multiple Detection Methods:

-Isolation Forest for outlier detection
-LSTM for sequential pattern analysis
-Statistical analysis for basic anomalies


2. Feature Engineering:

-Transaction amount analysis
-Temporal pattern detection
-Wallet behavior analysis
-Gas price monitoring


3. Comprehensive Scoring:

-Combined anomaly scores
-Risk level classification
-Multiple detection weights


4. Production-Ready Features:

-Proper logging
-Error handling
-Configuration management
-Documentation
-Type hints
